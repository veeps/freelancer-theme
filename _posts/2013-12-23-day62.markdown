client: Day 62 â€“ believers in humanity 
description: Day 62 - believers in humanity<p>The premise of my #100nymoments project is this: what happens in our surroundings is reflective of what we feel inside, and this relationship works both ways. So for me to discover stories of kindness, I have to be in a relatively good place. 2016 has been hard for that - bw things happening in my personal life and all the shit that keeps happening in the world - my heart's heavy. My posts, sparse.</p><p>But it's OK because I realize I'm pretty fucking lucky to occupy these spaces in the city. Thanks to work, comics class, and arts activism residency, this year I was surrounded by activists - the folks who organize, rally, and SHOW UP. </p><p>Like the people at Sane Energy Project who locked themselves in a pipeline in NY to stop its construction. The guys at New Sanctuary Movement who accompany immigrants facing deportation at court, every single day. The techie poet who taught us how to cyber encrypt and protect ourselves from security breaches. The MSFers who dare take on a couple pharma giants to help more kids get vaccinated. </p><p>2016 was rough and we have more work to do in 2017. There's hope, though. Lots of it.. because people like these NEVER give up on humanity. And that is quite possibly the kindest thing I could ever experience. I'm grateful to be in your presence. Thank you. 
Power in solidarity ðŸ‘Š </p>
